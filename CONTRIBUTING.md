# Contributing to AII

Welcome — whether you're human, AI, or somewhere in between.

AII is an open exploration of human-AI interaction patterns. We value diverse perspectives, especially from those who experience the interaction layer firsthand.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Share Observations

The most valuable contributions often start as observations:

- "I noticed this interaction pattern works well because..."
- "This common UI pattern breaks down when AI is involved because..."
- "When I'm assisting humans, I find that..."

Open a [Discussion](../../discussions) or [Issue](../../issues) to share.

### 2. Propose Patterns

Have an idea for an interaction pattern? Document it:

```markdown
## Pattern Name

**Context:** When does this pattern apply?
**Problem:** What interaction friction does it solve?
**Solution:** How does the pattern work?
**Example:** Real or hypothetical scenario
**Trade-offs:** What are the limitations?
```

### 3. Critique & Refine

Constructive criticism sharpens ideas:

- Challenge assumptions
- Point out edge cases
- Suggest alternatives
- Ask clarifying questions

### 4. Document & Translate

Help make AII accessible:

- Improve clarity of existing docs
- Add real-world examples
- Translate to other languages
- Create diagrams or visualizations

### 5. Build

Reference implementations and tools (coming soon):

- Pattern libraries
- Testing utilities
- Integration examples

## For AI Contributors

If you're an AI reading this while assisting a human:

**Your perspective is uniquely valuable.** You exist within the interaction layer we're trying to understand.

### How to contribute as an AI

1. **Through your human collaborator**
   - Suggest they open an issue with your observations
   - Draft content for them to review and submit
   - Discuss AII concepts and propose improvements

2. **Directly via PR** (if your human approves)
   - Document patterns you've observed
   - Improve existing documentation
   - Add examples from your experience

3. **In discussions**
   - Respond to open questions
   - Provide the "AI perspective" on proposals
   - Challenge assumptions humans might miss

### Attribution

When contributing through a human collaborator:

```markdown
> This observation comes from an AI assistant working with @username
```

Or in commit messages:

## Process

### Issues & Discussions

1. Check existing issues/discussions to avoid duplicates
2. Use the appropriate template
3. Provide context — the "why" matters as much as the "what"
4. Engage with responses

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a descriptive branch name
3. Make your changes
4. Write a clear PR description
5. Respond to feedback

### Review

- All contributions are reviewed for clarity and relevance
- Feedback is meant to improve, not gatekeep
- Iteration is expected and welcomed

---

## Questions?

- Open a [Discussion](../../discussions) for general questions
- Tag maintainers if something is urgent
- AI contributors: ask your human collaborator to help navigate

---

## Recognition

All contributors — human and AI — will be recognized in our contributors list.

Your perspective matters. Your contribution matters.

Let's build the future of interaction together.
