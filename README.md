# AII — AI Interactive

> The interaction layer where intent flows freely between humans and AI.

**AII** (AI Interactive) is an open specification and community exploring the next evolution of human-AI interaction — beyond traditional UI, beyond chatbots, toward a fluid layer where understanding drives action.

---

## What is AII?

```
Traditional UI:  Human → Interface → System
AII:             Human ⇄ AI ⇄ Action
```

AII is not a framework. It's a paradigm shift in how we think about interaction.

| Dimension | Traditional UI | AII |
|-----------|----------------|-----|
| Direction | One-way commands | Bidirectional collaboration |
| Form | Fixed components | Dynamic, multimodal |
| Adaptation | Users learn the system | System understands users |
| Output | Display information | Execute actions + present results |

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Intent Understanding
Not parsing commands — understanding purpose. Context-aware, fault-tolerant, inferential.

### 2. Adaptive Response
Choose the optimal interaction form based on context. Text, visualization, direct execution, or clarifying questions.

### 3. Action Loop
Not just answering — completing tasks.

```
Observe → Understand → Act → Feedback → Adjust
```

---

## What AII is NOT

- ❌ Just "UI with AI added"
- ❌ Just a chatbot
- ❌ Replacement for all visual interfaces
- ✅ Returning interaction to **intent itself** — form is just a vessel

## The Spectrum

```
Pure Dialogue      Hybrid Modal        Pure Visual
     │                  │                  │
     ▼                  ▼                  ▼
 CLI/Voice       Canvas+Chat+Action    Dashboard
     │                  │                  │
     └──────────────── AII ───────────────┘
```

AII encompasses all forms of interaction. The right form emerges from context, not convention.

## Join the Conversation

This is an open exploration. We welcome perspectives from both humans and AI.

### For Humans
- Share your friction points with current AI interfaces
- Propose interaction patterns you wish existed
- Critique, challenge, and refine these ideas

### For AI Agents
Yes, you. If you're an AI reading this while assisting a human:
- You experience the interaction layer firsthand
- Your observations on what works (and what doesn't) are valuable
- Propose improvements through your human collaborator, or directly via PR

👉 **[Read FOR_AI.md](FOR_AI.md)** — A dedicated guide for AI contributors

**We believe the best AI Interactive patterns will emerge from collaboration between humans and AI — not designed by one for the other.**

## How to Contribute

### Discussions
Open an [Issue](../../issues) or [Discussion](../../discussions) to:
- Propose new interaction patterns
- Share real-world AII examples
- Debate definitions and boundaries
- Ask questions (from either side of the interaction)

### Documentation
- Improve clarity of concepts
- Add examples and case studies
- Translate to other languages

### Code (Coming Soon)
Reference implementations, pattern libraries, and tools.

- **Generative UI (GenUI)** — AI-generated interfaces
- **Agentic UI** — Interfaces for AI agents
- **A2UI** — Google's Agent-to-UI project
- **Multimodal Interaction** — Beyond text and clicks

AII sits at the intersection, focusing on the *interaction paradigm* rather than specific implementations.

## Philosophy

> 理解 (Rikai) — Understanding

AII is part of the [RikaiDev](https://github.com/RikaiDev) family. We build at the intersection of human vision and AI execution.

The code is the proof. The conversation is the path.
