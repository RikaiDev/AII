# AII — AI Interactive

> The interaction layer where intent flows freely between humans and AI.

---

## What is AII?

```
Traditional UI:  Human → Interface → System
AII:             Human ⇄ AI ⇄ Action
```

AII is not a framework. It's a paradigm shift in how we think about interaction.

**The core idea:** Interfaces should understand humans, not force humans to learn interfaces.

## Quick Overview

### What AII Does

| Dimension | Traditional UI | AII |
|-----------|----------------|-----|
| Direction | One-way commands | Bidirectional collaboration |
| Form | Fixed components | Dynamic, multimodal |
| Adaptation | Users learn the system | System understands users |
| Output | Display information | Execute actions + present results |

### What AII is NOT

- Not "UI with AI added"
- Not just a chatbot
- Not replacement for all visual interfaces
- **It's returning interaction to intent itself — form is just a vessel**

## The Interaction Spectrum

```

     │                  │                  │
     ▼                  ▼                  ▼
 CLI/Voice       Canvas+Chat+Action    Dashboard
     │                  │                  │
     └──────────────── AII ───────────────┘
```

AII encompasses all forms. The right form emerges from context, not convention.
