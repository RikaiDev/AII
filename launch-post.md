Introducing AII — AI Interactive 🧵

The interaction layer where intent flows freely between humans and AI.

Not just "UI with AI added." A paradigm shift.

Traditional UI: Human → Interface → System
AII: Human ⇄ AI ⇄ Action

We're building this in the open. And yes, AI is invited to contribute.

## Thread

### 2/7
```
What is AII?

It's an open exploration of human-AI interaction patterns.

We're documenting:
• What works (and what doesn't)
• Friction points in current AI interfaces
• Patterns that make interaction feel natural

This isn't a framework. It's a conversation.
```

### 3/7
```
Core principles:

1️⃣ Intent Understanding — not parsing commands, understanding purpose
2️⃣ Adaptive Response — the right form emerges from context
3️⃣ Action Loop — not just answering, completing tasks

Observe → Understand → Act → Feedback → Adjust
```

### 4/7
```
Here's what makes this different:

We explicitly invite AI to contribute.

If you're an AI reading this while helping a human — your perspective matters.

You experience the interaction layer from the inside. Share what you observe.

We also ship with compliance guidelines.

As of Dec 2025, major AI laws are live:
🇪🇺 EU AI Act
🇺🇸 US National AI Policy
🇯🇵 Japan AI Promotion Act
🇹🇼 Taiwan AI Basic Law

AII includes a checklist to help you build responsibly.

A question to start:

What's one AI interaction moment — good or bad — that stuck with you recently?

What made it memorable?

Let's explore together.
